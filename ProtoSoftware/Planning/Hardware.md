# Hardware

This document outlines what I plan on doing with hardware.

---

most of the motors will be NEO 550s, some can be servos. I'll use REV Robotics hardware for a few reasons:
* I'm familiar with their some of their products since our robotics team (robolions, 2199) uses their motors, CANSpark max motor controllers, power distribution boards, LED controllers, and more
* It's easy to use thanks to [WPILib](https://wpilib.org/).
This assumes that I can use REV hardware easily without FRC stuff.
