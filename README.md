# Protogen
A repository for all of the software, research, and planning that will go into building a fully functional, life-size protogen.

## Important note
I've decided to put this project on hold for the following reasons:
* I'm too busy to really work on this
* I'm at a point where I need actual hardware (motors and such) to experiment with
* I don't really know which direction I'm going to go with this
* I've lost all motivation for it atm
