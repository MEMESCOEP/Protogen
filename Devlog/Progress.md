  [*] Object detection works, but is slow when run on a Raspberry Pi 4 (5 fps ðŸ’€) (NEEDS OPTIMIZATION BADLY!!!)
  <br/>
  [*] Communication between the central server (4GB RAM RPI) and the ImageProcessingClient (8GB RAM RPI) works decently well
  [*] The frame size in "ImageProcessingClient.py" should be set to a low resolution for best results (Currently using 320x200)
